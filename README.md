## Amazon Connect Integration for Aspect WFM

This Quick Start configures resources to provide integration between Amazon Connect and Aspect Workforce Management (WFM) in a few easy steps. 

This integration enhances standard Amazon Connect reports with statistics based on agent sign-in/sign-out information. You can designate whether custom agent status labels defined in Amazon Connect should be treated as available, productive, signed in, or signed out. Aspect WFM uses this information to produce statistics on average positions staffed (APS) by agent group, available time by agent, unavailable time by agent, and sign-in/sign-out pairs by agent.
